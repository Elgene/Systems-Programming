Assignment 3

Task 1: CORE
===============

1) wait(NULL);

2) In Linux, the return value for the fork system call is  PID of child for the 
parent process, and 0 for the child process. 

3)
(a) New -valid
(b) Running -valid
(c) Sleeping- not valid
(d) Waiting -valid

4) The synchronous is a blocking scenario where given processA send data to processB 
for processing and till the time processB return the result back , processA waits where
it gets block till it recieved the data back and then it begins it execution.

Whereas,Asynchronous is non-blocking scenario, after sending the message to processB for performing 
some operations, processA continue the execution after some time the processB would 
return the result , processA  fetches the result and continue it.

5) int sockfd = socket(int domain,int type,int protocol);


6)
a)false 
b)true   
c)false
d)true

7 (c) bind, listen, accept, recv 

Task 2: COMPLETION
====================

1)

before fork
pidA = 0, pidB = -1, var = 81
pidA = 560, pidB = 560,var = 80


2) It does not print HELLO at all because the current process replaced with "ls" command.


3)(d) sendto - because this is used for UDP socket


Task3:CHALLENGE 
=================
1(a) it prints 15 times 
 
(b) refer to part1t3.pdf
